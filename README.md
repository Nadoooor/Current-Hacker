## Description:
### This is my first PCB and my first use of Kicad. A PCB detects the current flowing in a wire using a coil and transistors. It is in the shape of a snake, and the coil is its tongue. It has two LEDs in its eyes that light up when it detects current, also it vibrates near its tail.
